# Methods

This experiment mostly copies Lisi and Cavanagh's (2015) methodology.

## Setup

- Sampling rate of 1kHz. 
- Distance to screen 60cm. 
- Monitor should be gamma-linearized if possible.
- Track the right eye. 

## Procedure

### 1) Perceptual task

Use multiple interleaved QUEST staircase to find 50% proportion of "right-shift" responses. Left and right shifts 
should be randomly interleaved in 2 session of 240 trials each, divided into 6 blocks. 


### 2) Saccade task

Each trial starts with participants fixating on a dot in the center of the screen. After a random interval sampled 
uniformly from 400-600ms, the frame appears at the central position of its motion path. Participants saccade to the 
target as soon as the fixation point disappears.\
Starting from the first path reversal, the fixation can disappear at one of six points in time equally spaced along a
full cycle of motion.\
As soon as the gaze position is detected to go 2dva outside of away from fixation, the target should be removed.\
We run 2 sessions of this task, each comprising 384 trials divided into 12 blocks.\
If fixation is broken, the trial should be aborted and put at the end of the block.
