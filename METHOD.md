# Methods

This experiment mostly copies Lisi and Cavanagh's (2015) methodology.

## Setup

- Sampling rate of 1kHz. 
- Distance to screen 60cm. 
- Monitor should be gamma-linearized if possible.
- Track the right eye. 

## Procedure

### 1) Perceptual task

Use multiple interleaved QUEST staircase to find 50% proportion of "right-shift" responses. Left and right shifts 
should be randomly interleaved in 2 session of 240 trials each, divided into 6 blocks. 


### 2) Saccade task

- _Fixation period_: Each trial starts with participants fixating on a dot in the center of the screen. 
  After a random interval sampled uniformly from 400-600ms, the frame appears at the left-most position of its path.
- _Stabilization period_: The frame moves for a minimum of 3 cycles of its motion. Probes flash for 3-5 frames at 
  the reversal points of the frame.
- _Cue period_: After the stabilization period, the fixation disappears at one of six points in time equally 
  spaced along a full cycle of motion on each trial. The disappearance is the participants' cue to saccade to the 
  "red" probe.
- _Saccade_: As soon as the gaze position is detected to be 2dva away from center of fixation, the target (red probe) 
  is removed.\

We run 2 sessions of this task, each comprising 384 trials divided into 12 blocks. If fixation is broken, 
the trial should be aborted and put at the end of the block.
